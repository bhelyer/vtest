# VTest

VTest is a unit testing framework in the xUnit style for the [Volt Programming Language](volt-lang.org).

As you can see, it's pretty simple; it's just as much as I need (so the Assert functions will be added over time etc), and my uh 'build scripts' use a distribution of Volt that I made for myself, but that's no reason not to share it.
